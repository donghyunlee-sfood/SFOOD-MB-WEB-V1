# Iteration 02 Plan

## Objective
Expand the memo website from MVP to near-complete functional scope aligned with SRS high-priority features.

## Development Steps
1. Create iteration-02 analysis with feature mapping and gaps.
2. Implement authentication flow UI and session checks (API-ready with local mock mode).
3. Implement board tree, create child board, rename inline, logical delete, move handling, and LNB resize.
4. Implement memo canvas with type toolbar, create/edit/complete mode, autosave delay, drag, resize, delete.
5. Implement context menu for z-index ordering actions and board zoom with Ctrl + wheel.
6. Add tests for core logic and update reports.

## Acceptance for Iteration 02
- Login/logout and session-like flow available in app.
- Board and memo core SRS interactions are available in UI.
- Tests pass and test evidence is documented.
